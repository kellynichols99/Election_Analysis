<h1>Challange Summary</h1>

Being able to use a single tool for multiple years of result analysis is an incredibly efficient use time time and resources, as well as a great way to simplify large sets of data. 
<p>
This script can be used with some modifications to review future election results as you see fit. You can make minor edits to the code to allow the expansion of review to the state level by replacing the counties with states, additionally you can make it fit to smaller demographics with cities, towns, or zip codes. We could also expand the code to pull the number of registered votes to compare with the voter turnout. 
<p>
This single resource can maintained for years of use. Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to make any changes.
